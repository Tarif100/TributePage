        <h2 class="topic2">Student life</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">Kalam was extremely earnest and diligent in his studies, but his teachers recognised him as having 
            a tremendous desire to study. He finished his secondary studies at Ramanathapuram’s Schwartz Secondary School. In 
            1955, he graduated from Saint Joseph’s College at Tiruchirappalli with a diploma in physics. He subsequently went to 
            Madras to further his education, graduating from the Engineering And Technology Institute with a diploma in aircraft 
            engineering. His dream of becoming a military pilot was crushed when the IAF only had eight slots available, and he 
            finished ninth. Following graduation, he worked as a scientist for the “Defense Research Service” and the “Aeronautical 
            Development Establishment.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph1">On graduation from the University of Madras in 1960, APJ Abdul Kalam returned to the Defence 
            Research and Development organisation Organisation as a scientist (DRDO). He began his career by creating a 
            tiny hovercraft, however his position with the DRDO did not persuade him. APJ Abdul Kalam was moved to the Indian 
            Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969 as the project head of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle, which 
            successfully launched the Rohini satellite into relatively near orbit in July 1980.</p>

        <h2 class="topic1">Death:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph1">Shillong, Meghalaya, on July 27, 2015.<br>
            The day we left a man who desired a miracle for India’s youth was a bad day for India. He falls inside the lecture 
            hall only 5 minutes into it, about 6:35 p.m. In critical condition, he was brought to ‘Bethany Hospital.’ He was 
            maintained in the intensive-care unit but showed no signs of life, and he was certified dead at 7:45 p.m. because 
            of cardiac arrest. <br>
            APJ Abdul Kalam is a very kind-hearted individual who generously performed many things for India. He is indeed 
            the reason we have nuclear weapons today. He not only became President & did a lot of good for India, but he also
             made a significant contribution to missile history.</p>
